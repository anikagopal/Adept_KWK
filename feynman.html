  <h2 class="feyHead">Feynman Technique</h2>
   <h3 class="head3">About this method:</h3>
  <div class="aboutFeyman">
    <p class="para3">
      The Feynman technique is a study tactic which is great for revising things you need help sticking into your head before a big test. In this method, start by explaining your topic in detail as well as you can and then dumb it down into its main points. Finally you wanna take that dumbed down list of points and use to to pretend you are teaching this topic to someone aloud with the points as references.
